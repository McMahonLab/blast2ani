### BLASTing metagenome closest to SAG collection against SAGs

This section documents the workflow for BLASTing the reads from one metagenome (collected closest to SAG collection), with no identity cutoff, against a set of single cell genomes.  Resulting in Figure 2 of the manuscript.

#### Running BLAST and filtering results

Ran the following on each SAG individually.  Where:  
	- blastn version = 2.2.31
	- SAG = SAG fna file (without rrna and contigs renamed for parsing ease) 
	- metagenome = the fna file of the metagenome reads
	- outname = name for resulting blastfile 

```
makeblastdb -in SAG -out SAG.db -dbtype nucl
blastn -task blastn -db SAG.db -query metagenome -out outname.blast -evalue 0.001 -outfmt 6
```

For each resulting blast file, filtered out hits shorter than 200bp (alignment length is the 4th column in the standard BLAST out format 6).
```
awk '($4 > 200)' outname.blast > outname.blast.len200
```

Wanted only the best hits (if a read hits that SAG/genome more than once).
Wrote blast_besthit.py to keep only the top hit (based on bit score).  If same bit score, keeps first one.
Ran the following command on each filtered blast result.

```
./blast\_besthit.py -blast_in outname.blast.len200
```
Resulting files have same name and end in .bbh

#### Non-competitive results

Parsed results into one file for each group (ME-acI, nonME-acI, ME-LD12, nonME-LD12, and ME-others)

Visualized results with vis_scripts/makeFig2\_plotseqdiscden.R

#### Competitive results

Also needed results that were competitive within acI and within LD12 groups.  Used blast_besthit.py to choose.

Concatenated all the within SAG bbh results for LD12 (PTXW.len150-vs-LD12\_norrna\_short.blast.len200.bbh) and acI (PTXW.len150-vs-acI\_norrna.fna\_short.blast.len200.bbh) into one file for each group.

Ran the following commands on them, -kb stand for keep all best, so it will count a read twice if the bit score is the same for 2 hits (since we can't tell which one it belongs to)
```
./blast\_besthit.py -bin LD12/PTXW.len150-vs-LD12\_norrna\_short.blast.len200.bbh -kb
./blast\_besthit.py -bin acI/PTXW.len150-vs-acI\_norrna.fna_short.blast.len200.bbh -kb
```

Parsed results into one file for each group (ME-acI, nonME-acI, ME-LD12, nonME-LD12)

Visualized results with vis\_scripts/competative\_plotseqdiscden.R

### BLASTing all metagenomes against all SAGs

This section documents the workflow for BLASTing the reads from all metagenomes, with identity cutoff, against a set of single cell genomes.  Resulting in Figure 4 of the manuscript.

#### Running BLAST 
Ran the following on each SAG and metagenome combo individually.  Where:  
	- blastn version = 2.2.31
	- used already made blastdb's from blast single metagenome (info above)
	- SAG.db = SAG blast db made from fna file (without rrna and contigs renamed for parsing ease) 
	- metagenome = the fna file of the metagenome reads
	- outname = name for resulting blastfile 

```
blastn -task blastn -db SAG.db -query metagenome -out outname.blast -evalue 0.001 -outfmt 6 -perc_identity 95
```
I named all of the output files with this scheme: metagenome-vs-SAG.blast

#### Reformatting, filtering, and pooling resulting BLAST files

Reformatted the BLAST results to be more useful for me. Then filtered them only keeping hits longer than 200bp and > 97.5 identity.  Then I replaced the metagenome names with the month and year to pool the results by month.

##### Reformatting resulting BLAST files

All the raw blast results were in a folder called raw\_blast\_all
Ran the following commands to get the names of all the SAGs from the blast results and then use grep to combine and add the metagenome information in at the same time.
```
ls raw_blast_all/*.blast | cut -d - -f 3 | cut -d _ -f 1 | sort | uniq > SAGnames.txt
while read line; do echo $line; grep $line raw_blast_all/*$line*.blast > MEmeta-vs-$line.blast; done < SAGnames.txt
```

Removing path from metagenome name and then making that its own column.  All my metagenome names have '.len150' after the library name so I split on that.
```
for file in MEmeta-vs-A*; do sed -i.ibak 's/raw\_blast\_all\///g' $file; done
rm *.ibak
for file in MEmeta-vs-A*.blast; do sed -i.ibak 's/.len150/        len150/g' $file; done
rm *.ibak
```
Removed backups after checking that proccess was successful. 

##### Filtering resulting blast files

Ran the following for each reformatted blast result file.  Where:  
	- blastfile = newly reformatted blast file

```
awk '($5 > 200)' blastfile | awk '($4 > 97.5)' > blastfile.len200.id975; done
```

##### Pooling Results by Month

Pooled data by month by replacing metagenome names with year and month by running poolBLASTS.py on each filtered and formated blast result file. Where:  
	- blastfile.len200.id975 = the resulting file from reformatting and filtering.  
	- sample_data.txt = a tab-separated file with the following columns in it (in order):  
		sample, reads, bps, layer, date, year, month, day
		
```
./poolBLASTS.py blastfile.len200.id975 sample_data.txt
```

##### Getting best hit files

Wanted only the best hits (if a read hits that SAG/genome more than once).
Used blast\_besthit.py to keep only the top hit (based on bit score).  If same bit score, keeps first one.
Ran the following command on each reformatted, filtered, and pooled blast results(blastfile.len200.id975.pooled):

```
./blast_besthit.py --blast_in blastfile.len200.id975.pooled --pooled
```

#### Getting coverage and abundance values

Inputs:  
	- Blast results file(s) (reformatted, filtered, pooled, and bbh) called blastfile.len200.id975.pooled.ind.bbh below  
	- Metagenome size file (where metagenome names are replaced with pooled names), pools will be totalled in script below (and anything after '.' removed later and what is left should match pool names in blast files), called pooledmetagenomesize.txt below  
		E.g. 2008_09.len	653414814  
			 2008_07.len	856300613  
		was: CSCW.len	653414814  
			 CSCX.len	856300613  
	- SAG/genome size file (anything after first '\_' removed and what is left should match SAG/genome names in blast file contig names), called genomeSizesSAGs.txt below  
		E.g. AAA027C02_norrna_short.len	1265699  
			 AAA027D23_norrna_short.len	942294  
			 AAA027G08_norrna_short.len	1320847  

Concatenated all reformatted, filtered, pooled and individual bbh files together(blastfile.len200.id975.pooled.ind.bbh).

```
./calculateCovVals.py -all_blast 'blastfile.len200.id975.pooled.ind.bbh' -mSF pooledmetagenomesize.txt -gSF genomeSizesSAGs.txt -bbh 
```

Outputs the following files:  
covered\_bases.txt - adding up all of the alignment lengths - gaps for a each season and SAG/genome  
genome\_cov.txt - divides covered\_bases.txt numbers by size of each SAG/genome  
hit\_table.txt - counts number of hits for each season and SAG/genome  
normalized\_cov.txt - devides genome\cov.txt by size of each pool (which was get added together earlier in the script)  
pid.txt - the average percent identity of all of this hits for each season and SAG/genome  

To get the abundance values in the manuscript, we multiplied the normalized_coverage.txt values by the average pool size (which was 3506155780, rounding 3506155779.9166665 to nearest integer)

Scripts for Visualization of Figure 4 and 5 not included in repo.

Note: calculateCovVals.py will also calculate these values by contigs instead of SAGs with the right arguments and inputs
